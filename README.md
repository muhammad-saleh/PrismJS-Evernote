# PrismJS-Evernote
I use Evernote as my snippets manager and I need to copy formatted code into Evernote so I will use PrimsJS for that

The basic idea is just to have a simple easy to use code formatter.

You can paste a fomatted text (HTML/RTF) into Evernote and it will keep it style
So the problem is sometimes you can't find an easy to use code formatter easily or it might not look as you expected
So here I will try to create a solution for that

### Roadmap

- [x] Create the basic functionality
- [ ] Switch to Angular for better performance
- [ ] Wrap this in a node-webkit app

### Use as an app
My perfect workflow is that while I'm adding a note with a code in it I want to fire up an app to add my code and then
paste the code and instantly it's formatted
So in the future plan this should be wrapped inside an app but till I get there you might have solutions

#### Mac
Use an application called [fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) where you can add the file path to the index.html page of this project
and then it will be wrapped inside of an app

#### Windows
You can pin it to the browser or please refer to this [link](http://www.howtogeek.com/141431/how-to-turn-web-apps-into-first-class-desktop-citizens/)
