# PrismJS-Evernote
I use Evernote as my snippets manager and I need to copy formatted code into Evernote so I will use PrimsJS for that

The basic idea is just to have a simple easy to use code formatter.

You can paste a fomatted text (HTML/RTF) into Evernote and it will keep it style
So the problem is sometimes you can't find an easy to use code formatter easily or it might not look as you expected
So here I will try to create a solution for that

### Roadmap

- [x] Create the basic functionality
- [ ] Switch to Angular for better performance
- [ ] Wrap this in a node-webkit app
